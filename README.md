# VulnToolkit 

VulnToolkit is an R package for users working with coastal datasets. Its primary goal is to advance analysis of coastal wetlands and their vulnerability to sea-level rise. The package has two emphases: 

* web scrapers, built to make it easy to bring coastal and estuarine data from on-line databases into R
* analytical tools, to aid analysis of datasets from coastal and estuarine settings



To install and load VulnToolkit, run the following commands in R:

`install.packages("devtools")` # if devtools isn't already installed

`library(devtools)`

`install_github("troyhill/VulnToolkit")`

`library(VulnToolkit)`
